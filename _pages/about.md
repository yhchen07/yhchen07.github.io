* I am currently in my final year at the University of Manchester (UoM), majoring in Psychology (Hons). I rank within the **top 1%** of my cohort of over 400 people. My research interests are **emotion regulation and social inequalities**. I have gained extensive experience working in research labs and possess variety of skills, including participants recruitment, data collection, literature review, manuscripts preparation and presentations. My toolkit includes MPlus, SPSS, Qualtrics, Python, and Momentary Ecological Assessment.
* I am passionate about supporting **underrepresented** groups. I have been an active member of the Under-represented Student Perspective Panel at UoM for two years, and I devote my spare time to supporting the local LGBTQ+ community.
* I am set to graduate in 2024 and am currently **seeking a PhD position starting from the fall of 2024**.
